# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

class Solution:
    # i actually couldn't figure this out during my amazon interview, which sucks, since I realized this is actually 
    # quite a simple problem. Sucks a lot, and hopefully I can crack FAANG+ next year.

    # The key to solving this problem is realizing that you can return any peak
    # that means that if you continue to split the array in half (like binary search)
    # in the direction of the larger neighbor to the middle element, you will eventually find a peak
    # this is because if the middle element is not a peak, then one of its neighbors must be larger,
    # and if you continue to search in that direction, you will eventually find a peak.
    # this solution has a time complexity of O(log n) and a space complexity of O(1)
